# Election_Analysis

**Election Analysis PyPoll Challenge**

*Overview of the Project*

The purpose of this analysis was to create a Python program that listed out election audit results, and then print out the county voter turnout, as well as the percentage of each votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout. From there, it would determine candidate votes and who won the election overall. 

*Results*

- 369,711 votes were cast in this election
- Jefferson had around 10% of the votes with 38,555 votes in total. Denver had 82.8% of the votes with 306,555 votes. Arapahoe had 6.7% of the votes with 24,801 votes.
- Denver had the largest number of votes
- Charles Casper Stockham had 23.5% of the votes with 85,213 votes won
- Diana DeGette had 73.8% of the votes with 272,892 votes won
- Raymon Anthony Doane had 3.1% of the votes with 11,606 votes won
- Diana DeGette won the election by a substantial majority


*Summary*

The script can be used for any election going forward to determine how likely it is for a specific county to have a higher or lower voter turnout, and in turn how many cotes will be cast towards different candidates. The script can be modified by altering the way the voter turnout is calculated, how many counties are being considered, how many candidates are being elected, and vice versa.
