# Election_Analysis

**Election Analysis PyPoll Challenge**

*Overview of the Project*

The purpose of this analysis was to create a Python program that listed out election audit results, and then print out the county voter turnout, as well as the percentage of each votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout. From there, it would determine candidate votes and who won the election overall.
